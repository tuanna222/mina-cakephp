# mina-cakephp

mina-cakephp is a gem that adds many tasks to aid in the deployment of [CakePHP v2.x] (http://www.cakephp.org) applications
using [Mina] (http://nadarei.co/mina).
For CakePHP v3.x, please go to https://github.com/tuanna222/mina-cakephp3

# Getting Start

## Instalation
	git clone https://github.com/tuanna222/mina-cakephp.git
	cd mina-cakephp && gem build mina-cakephp.gemspec && gem install mina-cakephp-1.0.1.gem

## Configuration

After installation, create a file in the root directory of your project called `Minafile`.

Note: Mina uses the command `mina init` to create a config file at `config/deploy.rb`, but CakePHP use the `Config` directory to hold configurations.
To avoid problems we recommend using `Minafile` instead of `config/deploy.rb`

`Minafile` sample:

	require 'mina/git'
	# Load tasks of mina-cakephp
	require 'mina-cakephp'

	# Mina default configuration
	# more info at http://nadarei.co/mina
	set :domain, 'server.to.deploy.com' 
	set :deploy_to, '/var/www/my-app'
	set :repository, 'git@mysever:my-app.git'
	set :user, 'root'

	# Shared file or folder between deploys
	# more at http://nadarei.co/mina/tasks/deploy_link_shared_paths.html
	set :shared_paths, ['Config/database.php', 'tmp']

	## mina-cakephp Settings
	# Defines the  CakePHP core path. 
	# This path is used to execute bake commands and update webroot/index.php if needed.
	#set :cake_path, '/var/www/libs/cakephp'

## Contributing to mina-cakephp
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
